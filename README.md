## Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (if it's on Git) or download the files.**
    If this project is part of your `PH-Assignment-1` repository, users might clone that. Otherwise, provide a specific repository link if it's standalone.
    ```bash
    # Example for the collection:
    # git clone [https://github.com/HedaetShahriar/PH-Assignment-1.git](https://github.com/HedaetShahriar/PH-Assignment-1.git)
    # cd PH-Assignment-1/YourProjectFolder  (Replace YourProjectFolder)
    ```
2.  **Ensure the folder structure is maintained as described above.** The CSS file (`styles/style.css`) and all images in the `assets/` folder must be in their correct relative paths for the page to render correctly.
3.  **Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.**

No special compilation or build steps are required.

## Customization

* **Content:** Modify the text content directly in the `index.html` file.
* **Styling:** Adjust colors, fonts, layout, and other visual aspects in the `styles/style.css` file.
* **Images:** Replace images in the `assets/` folder. Ensure new image paths are updated in `index.html` and `style.css` if names or locations change.
* **The `opinion` section in `index.html` is currently empty and can be populated with relevant content and styled accordingly.**
